'''
Here is a sample code in Python to list the files in the parent directory 
(assuming that the current working directory has a parent directory):
'''
import os

# Get the current working directory
cwd = os.getcwd()

# Get the parent directory
parent_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(cwd, os.pardir))

# Get a list of all files in the parent directory
files = [f for f in os.listdir(parent_dir) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(parent_dir, f))]

# Print the list of files
print(files)

'''
This code uses the os and os.path modules to get the current working 
directory using the getcwd method, and then get the parent directory using the 
abspath and join methods. The listdir method is used to get a list of all the 
files in the parent directory, and the isfile method is used to filter the list 
and only include regular files (not directories).
The list of files is then printed to the console.
