'''
Here is a sample code in Python to add the current date to a text file "today.txt" as a string, 
and then read the contents of the file into a string variable today_string:
'''
import datetime

# Get the current date and format it as a string
now = datetime.datetime.now()
today = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

# Open the file in write mode and add the string to it
with open("today.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(today)

# Open the file in read mode and read its contents into a string variable
with open("today.txt", "r") as file:
    today_string = file.read()
'''
This code first uses the datetime module to get the current date and time, 
formats it as a string using the strftime method, and writes it to the file "today.txt" using
the write method. The with statement is used to open the file in write mode and automatically 
close it after the block of code inside it has been executed. The code then opens the same file 
in read mode and reads its contents into the string variable today_string using the read method.
